User import configuration file reference
========================================

Configuration files are interpreted in a hierarchical way.
*Please read global_configuration_readme.txt first!*

After reading the global configuration options (1. and 2.), module specific
configuration is read. In case of the user import, those are:

3. /usr/share/ucs-school-import/configs/user_import_defaults.json (do not edit)
4. /var/lib/ucs-school-import/configs/user_import.json (edit this)

After that follow
5. Configuration file set on the command line.
6. Options set on the command line by --set and its aliases.


[1]: mandatory
[2]: default value for [3]
[3]: if this is not set, fall back to [2]
