Single source, partial import (SiSoPi) scenario
===============================================

Introduction
------------

The scenario in which a single source database for users in all schools exists, but the user import jobs will be run separately for each school, is supported since UCS\@school 4.3 v5 for both the command line and the HTTP-API import (via UMC module).

Features
--------

* OU spanning user accounts (a user can be member of multiple schools)
* Each school imports its users separately at a time and order of their choosing.

Requirements
------------

* A single source database exists that knows all users and has a globally unique ``record_uid`` for each of them.
* The source database exports separate CSV files per school and user type.
* As imports are done in random order, it is possible that to move a user from one school to another, it is first removed in one school and imported at the other school at a later time. The user account must not be deleted in the meantime.

Implementation
--------------

Initial implementation was done through `Bug #47447 <http://forge.univention.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47447>`_.

To make it possible to move a user from school *A* to *B* in two steps (deleting it first in school *A* and adding it later in school *B*), a "in-between school" is used: the ``limbo_ou``. It is a regular school OU, whose name is configurable (defaults to *limbo*).

Users that are deleted by the import from their last/only school (*A*) are a) immediately deactivated and b) moved there (*limbo*).

When/if a user is imported to be created in a school (*B*), and a user with its ``record_uid`` exists in *limbo*, it is moved to the school (*B*) and activated.

Installation & Configuration
----------------------------

Add the configuration in ``/usr/share/ucs-school-import/configs/user_import_sisopi.json`` to your import configuration (in ``/var/lib/ucs-school-import/configs/user_import.json``).

You may wish to adapt the ``deletion_grace_period`` settings:

* ``deletion_grace_period:deactivation`` *must* be ``0``.
* ``deletion_grace_period:deletion`` *should* be (a lot) higher than ``0``. It should be the maximum time in days that the imports of two schools may be apart. It is the time a user can exist in *limbo*, before going to the great beyond.

You may wish to adapt the name of the ``limbo_ou``.

Set the UCR variable ``ucsschool/import/http_api/set_source_uid`` to ``no`` and restart Gunicorn::

	ucr set ucsschool/import/http_api/set_source_uid=no
	service ucs-school-import-http-api restart


*If you want imported users to only be a member of one school at a time*, namely the one they were imported into lastly, and be immediately moved from any other school into the one being imported currently, the following config parameter can be set. Normally this behaviour is not wanted, thus the parameter is ``false`` by default. The imported users' memberships in school classes belonging to schools different from the one being imported currently will also be removed.

* ``dont_keep_other_schools`` *must* be ``true``
